# Hi, I’m @MattiasKallio
I’m mostly WordPress-expert-nerdy-nerd that help people with custom things in WP and when things don't work. So if things are not working i WP, I'm the guy you need. :) I also build custom plugins for more or less anything, both from scratch and addons to other plugins.

### I’m currently learning
Everything at once, but it's a lot of Arduino, 3D-printers etc. right now, I'm not really a C++ coder any more, but it's fun with micro controllers.

### How to reach me
* For development and services : <a href="https://snillrik.se">snillrik.se</a> 
* For buying plugins etc. : <a href="https://snillrik.com">snillrik.com</a>
* For me, email me: <a href="mailto:kallio@snillrik.se">kallio@snillrik.se</a>
