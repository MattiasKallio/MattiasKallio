- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MattiasKallio
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly WordPress-expert-nerdy-nerd that help people with custom things in WP and when things don't work. So if things are not working i WP, I'm the guy you need. :) I also build custom plugins for more or less anything, both from scratch and addons to other plugins.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning<br />
Everything at once, but it's a lot of Arduino, 3D-printers etc. right now, I'm not really a C++ coder any more, but it's fun with micro controllers.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me<br />
